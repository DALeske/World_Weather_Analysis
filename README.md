# Module 6 Challenge: World Weather Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this activity was to produce an app that would interface with users to find a vacation destination based on preferred weather conditions. The user provides the desired range of temperatures and the app displays random city locations around the world with current weather conditions matching the user's temperature criteria, along with nearby hotel locations. 

Although not automated, the user then may select a vacation destination, along with additional nearby cities to visit on their vacation.  The app then maps out the city of origin and the selected cities to be visited during the trip. Each city is marked on the map, along with hotel and weather information. Additionally, driving routes between cities are highlighted on the map.

## Example Search
The following is an example search. In this case, the user has entered the desired temperature range of 60 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit.
